  # In a 3x2 cross-hatched grid, a total of 37 different rectangles could be
  # situated within that grid as indicated in the sketch (see diagram).
  #
  # There are 5 grids smaller than 3x2, vertical and horizontal dimensions
  # being important, i.e. 1x1, 2x1, 3x1, 1x2 and 2x2. If each of them is
  # cross-hatched, the following number of different rectangles could be
  # situated within those smaller grids:
  #
  #   1x1: 1 
  #   2x1: 4 
  #   3x1: 8 
  #   1x2: 4 
  #   2x2: 18
  #
  # Adding those to the 37 of the 3x2 grid, a total of 72 different rectangles
  # could be situated within 3x2 and smaller grids.
  #
  # How many different rectangles could be situated within 47x43 and smaller
  # grids?
