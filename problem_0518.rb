  # Let S(n) = Î£ a+b+c over all triples (a,b,c) such that:
  #
  #   a, b, and c are prime numbers.
  #   a < b < c < n.
  #   a+1, b+1, and c+1 form a geometric sequence.
  #
  # For example, S(100) = 1035 with the following triples:
  #
  #   (2, 5, 11), (2, 11, 47), (5, 11, 23), (5, 17, 53), (7, 11, 17),
  #   (7, 23, 71), (11, 23, 47), (17, 23, 31), (17, 41, 97), (31, 47, 71),
  #   (71, 83, 97)
  #
  # Find S(10^8).
