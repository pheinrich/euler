  # In the hexadecimal number system numbers are represented using 16 diff-
  # erent digits:
  #
  #      0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F
  #
  # The hexadecimal number AF when written in the decimal number system equals
  # 10x16+15=175.
  #
  # In the 3-digit hexadecimal numbers 10A, 1A0, A10, and A01 the digits 0,1
  # and A are all present. Like numbers written in base ten we write hexa-
  # decimal numbers without leading zeroes.
  #
  # How many hexadecimal numbers containing at most sixteen hexadecimal digits
  # exist with all of the digits 0,1, and A present at least once? Give your
  # answer as a hexadecimal number.
  #
  # (A,B,C,D,E and F in upper case, without any leading or trailing code that
  # marks the number as hexadecimal and without leading zeroes, e.g. 1A3F and
  # not: 1a3f and not 0x1a3f and not $1A3F and not #1A3F and not 0000001A3F)
