  # A square is drawn around a circle as shown on the left in diagram 1. We
  # shall call the blue shaded region the L-section. A line is drawn from the
  # bottom left of the square to the top right as shown on the right in the
  # first diagram. We shall call the orange shaded region a concave triangle.
  #
  # It should be clear that the concave triangle occupies exactly half of the
  # L-section.
  #
  # Two circles are placed next to each other horizontally, a rectangle is
  # drawn around both circles, and a line is drawn from the bottom left to the
  # top right as shown in the second diagram.
  #
  # This time the concave triangle occupies approximately 36.46% of the
  # L-section.
  #
  # If n circles are placed next to each other horizontally, a rectangle is
  # drawn around the n circles, and a line is drawn from the bottom left to
  # the top right, then it can be shown that the least value of n for which
  # the concave triangle occupies less than 10% of the L-section is n = 15.
  #
  # What is the least value of n for which the concave triangle occupies less
  # than 0.1% of the L-section?

  def evalIntegralAt( x )
    # Evaluate the antiderivative of a circle of radius 1, tangent to both x
    # and y axes in the first quadrant. The formula for the whole circle is
    # (x - 1)^2 + (y - 1)^2 = 1, so the lower half would be described by
    # y = 1 - âˆš(1 - (x - 1)^2). Integrating this, we get the result below.

    # by the number of circles we want to test. The total area of the concave
    # triangle will be the sum of the area under that straight line (from 0 to
    # the abscissa of this intersection point) plus the area under the circle
    # (from that abscissa to 1).

      # first circle. Since that line has the equation y = x / circles, the
      # corresponding antiderivative is y = x^2 / 2*circles.
      area = x*x / (2*circles)
