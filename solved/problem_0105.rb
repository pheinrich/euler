  def title; 'Special subset sums: testing' end
  def difficulty; 45 end

  # Let S(A) represent the sum of elements in set A of size n. We shall call
  # it a special sum set if for any two non-empty disjoint subsets, B and C,
  # the following properties are true:
  #
  #      i.  S(B) â‰  S(C); that is, sums of subsets cannot be equal.
  #      ii. If B contains more elements than C then S(B) > S(C).
  #
  # For example, {81, 88, 75, 42, 87, 84, 86, 65} is not a special sum set
  # because 65 + 87 + 88 = 75 + 81 + 84, whereas {157, 150, 164, 119, 79, 159,
  # 161, 139, 158} satisfies both rules for all possible subset pair comb-
  # inations and S(A) = 1286.
  #
  # Using 0105_sets.txt, a 4K text file with one-hundred sets containing seven
  # to twelve elements (the two examples given above are the first two sets in
  # the file), identify all the special sum sets, A1, A2, ..., Ak, and find
  # the value of S(A1) + S(A2) + ... + S(Ak).
  #
  # NOTE: This problem is related to Problem 103 and Problem 106.

  # Brute force test that's about twice as fast as the polynomial check for
  # small batches like this. (Over thousands of comparisons, the polynomial
  # version exceeds 10x performance, however.)

    # We'll compute the sums for all 2^n possible subsets, which we'll
    # represent as binary polynomials. Since the cardinality of each subset
    # (important for checking condition 2, above) is just its Hamming weight,
    # we'll look at sums by subset size.

        sum = arr.each_with_index.map {|a, i| 1 == (poly >> i) & 1 ? a : 0}.reduce( :+ )

        # or it's a sum we've seen before, this set can't be special.

        # Mark this sum as seen so we'll know if we encounter it again. Also,
        # keep track of the max total for subsets of this size.

        # Move to the next subset with the same cardinality.
