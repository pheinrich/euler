  # If a box contains twenty-one coloured discs, composed of fifteen blue
  # discs and six red discs, and two discs were taken at random, it can be
  # seen that the probability of taking two blue discs,
  #
  #      P(BB) = (15/21)Ã—(14/20) = 1/2.
  #
  # The next such arrangement, for which there is exactly 50% chance of taking
  # two blue discs at random, is a box containing eighty-five blue discs and
  # thirty-five red discs.
  #
  # By finding the first arrangement to contain over 10^12 = 1,000,000,000,000
  # discs in total, determine the number of blue discs that the box would
  # contain.
