  # A number consisting entirely of ones is called a repunit. We shall define
  # R(k) to be a repunit of length k; for example, R(6) = 111111.
  #
  # Let us consider repunits of the form R(10^n).
  #
  # Although R(10), R(100), or R(1000) are not divisible by 17, R(10000) is
  # divisible by 17. Yet there is no value of n for which R(10^n) will divide
  # by 19. In fact, it is remarkable that 11, 17, 41, and 73 are the only four
  # primes below one-hundred that can be a factor of R(10^n).
  #
  # Find the sum of all the primes below one-hundred thousand that will never
  # be a factor of R(10^n).

    # OEIS.org shows that the sequence described above, starting with [11, 17,
    # 41, 73] (A178070), contains primes such that the multiplicative order of
    # 10 (mod p) takes the form 2^i * 5^j, with i,j >= 0. The multiplicative
    # order is the smallest power k such that 10^k â‰¡ 1 (mod p), which is the
    # same as saying 10^k % p = 1.
    #
    # We can prepare a table of valid multiplicative order values; we just
    # need to store all 2^i * 5^j combinations less than the 100k from the
    # problem statement. The max i, j are easily derived:
    #
    #   2^i < n            5^j < n
    #   ln 2^i < ln n      ln 5^j < ln n
    #   i(ln 2) < ln n     j(ln 5) < ln n
    #   i < ln n / ln 2    j < ln n / ln 5
    #
    # Once A(p) is computed for each potential prime, we just need to compare
    # it to the table entries to determine if it's valid.

    # Build the table of valid multiplicative order values. We'll just use the
    # larger of the i, j limits, taking advantage of the fact that log2 2 = 1.
    # The table will (harmlessly) have entries for p > n, but still be small.
