  def difficulty; 55 end

  # A hexagonal tile with number 1 is surrounded by a ring of six hexagonal
  # tiles, starting at "12 o'clock" and numbering the tiles 2 to 7 in an anti-
  # clockwise direction.
  #
  # New rings are added in the same fashion, with the next rings being
  # numbered 8 to 19, 20 to 37, 38 to 61, and so on. See diagram showing the
  # first three rings.
  #
  # By finding the difference between tile n and each of its six neighbours we
  # shall define PD(n) to be the number of those differences which are prime.
  #
  # For example, working clockwise around tile 8 the differences are 12, 29,
  # 11, 6, 1, and 13. So PD(8) = 3.
  #
  # In the same way, the differences around tile 17 are 1, 17, 16, 1, 11, and
  # 10, hence PD(17) = 2.
  #
  # It can be shown that the maximum value of PD(n) is 3.
  #
  # If all of the tiles for which PD(n) = 3 are listed in ascending order to
  # form a sequence, the 10th tile would be 271.
  #
  # Find the 2000th tile in this sequence.

  # We can classify every tile according to its angular position around the
  # unit circle, setting position 0 at the top since that's where each row
  # starts in the problem statement. Positions 1-5 then follow every 60Â° as we
  # work our way counter-clockwise. Depending on which of these positions each
  # tile falls (or between which pair of positions), we use different formulae
  # to calculate its six neighbors to the N, NW, SW, S, SE, and NE:
  # 
  # Pos 0: n even = fho
  #   N  = n + cr (g)            S  = n - cr + 6 (a)
  #   NW = n + cr + 1 (h)        SE = n + cr - 1 (f)
  #   SW = n + 1                 NE = n + cr + cr + 5 (o)

  #   N  = n + cr (g)            S  = n - cr + 6 (a)

  # From these formula, we can derive the difference between a tile and each
  # of its neighbors. If we arrange all potential differences in ascending
  # order, it becomes obvious that for n even or odd, some deltas will always
  # be even, and thus can never be prime (>2).
  #
  # Furthermore, we can see that only in certain positions will a tile ever
  # differ from three neighbors by odd amounts (position 0 and just to the
  # right of position 0). In all other cases, at most two deltas will be odd,
  # meaning PD(n) will be 2 or less.
