  # Using a combination of black square tiles and oblong tiles chosen from:
  # red tiles measuring two units, green tiles measuring three units, and blue
  # tiles measuring four units, it is possible to tile a row measuring five
  # units in length in exactly fifteen different ways (see problem_0117.png).
  #
  # How many ways can a row measuring fifty units in length be tiled?
  #
  # NOTE: This is related to Problem 116.
