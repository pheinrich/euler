  # We can easily verify that none of the entries in the first seven rows of
  # Pascal's triangle are divisible by 7:
  #
  #                     1
  #                  1     1
  #               1     2     1
  #            1     3     3     1
  #         1     4     6     4     1
  #      1     5    10    10     5     1
  #   1     6    15    20    15     6     1
  #
  # However, if we check the first one hundred rows, we will find that only
  # 2361 of the 5050 entries are not divisible by 7.
  #
  # Find the number of entries which are not divisible by 7 in the first one
  # billion (10^9) rows of Pascal's triangle.
