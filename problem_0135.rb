  # Given the positive integers, x, y, and z, are consecutive terms of an
  # arithmetic progression, the least value of the positive integer, n, for
  # which the equation, x2 − y2 − z2 = n, has exactly two solutions is n = 27:
  #
  #   34^2 − 27^2 − 20^2 = 12^2 − 9^2 − 6^2 = 27
  #
  # It turns out that n = 1155 is the least value which has exactly ten
  # solutions.
  #
  # How many values of n less than one million have exactly ten distinct
  # solutions?
