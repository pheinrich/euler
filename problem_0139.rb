  # Let (a, b, c) represent the three sides of a right angle triangle with
  # integral length sides. It is possible to place four such triangles
  # together to form a square with length c.
  #
  # For example, (3, 4, 5) triangles can be placed together to form a 5 by 5
  # square with a 1 by 1 hole in the middle and it can be seen that the 5 by 5
  # square can be tiled with twenty-five 1 by 1 squares (see diagram).
  #
  # However, if (5, 12, 13) triangles were used then the hole would measure
  # 7 by 7 and these could not be used to tile the 13 by 13 square.
  #
  # Given that the perimeter of the right triangle is less than one-hundred
  # million, how many Pythagorean triangles would allow such a tiling to take
  # place?
