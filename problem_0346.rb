  # The number 7 is special, because 7 is 111 written in base 2, and 11
  # written in base 6 (i.e. 7b10 = 11b6 = 111b2). In other words, 7 is a
  # repunit in at least two bases b > 1.
  #
  # We shall call a positive integer with this property a strong repunit. It
  # can be verified that there are 8 strong repunits below 50:
  # {1,7,13,15,21,31,40,43}.
  # 
  # Furthermore, the sum of all strong repunits below 1000 equals 15864.
  #
  # Find the sum of all strong repunits below 10^12.
