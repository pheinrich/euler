  # A positive integer, n, is divided by d and the quotient and remainder are
  # q and r respectively. In addition d, q, and r are consecutive positive
  # integer terms in a geometric sequence, but not necessarily in that order.
  #
  # For example, 58 divided by 6 has quotient 9 and remainder 4. It can also
  # be seen that 4, 6, 9 are consecutive terms in a geometric sequence (common
  # ratio 3/2).
  # We will call such numbers, n, progressive.
  #
  # Some progressive numbers, such as 9 and 10404 = 102^2, happen to also be
  # perfect squares. The sum of all progressive perfect squares below one
  # hundred thousand is 124657.
  #
  # Find the sum of all progressive perfect squares below one trillion
  # (10^12).
