  # The points P (x1, y1) and Q (x2, y2) are plotted at integer co-ordinates
  # and are joined to the origin, O(0,0), to form ΔOPQ (see diagram 1).
  #
  # There are exactly fourteen triangles containing a right angle that can be
  # formed when each co-ordinate lies between 0 and 2 inclusive; that is,
  # 0 ≤ x1, y1, x2, y2 ≤ 2 (see diagram 2).
  #
  # Given that 0 ≤ x1, y1, x2, y2 ≤ 50, how many right triangles can be
  # formed?
