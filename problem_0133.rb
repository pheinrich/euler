  # A number consisting entirely of ones is called a repunit. We shall define
  # R(k) to be a repunit of length k; for example, R(6) = 111111.
  #
  # Let us consider repunits of the form R(10^n).
  #
  # Although R(10), R(100), or R(1000) are not divisible by 17, R(10000) is
  # divisible by 17. Yet there is no value of n for which R(10^n) will divide
  # by 19. In fact, it is remarkable that 11, 17, 41, and 73 are the only four
  # primes below one-hundred that can be a factor of R(10^n).
  #
  # Find the sum of all the primes below one-hundred thousand that will never
  # be a factor of R(10^n).

    # OEIS.org shows that the sequence described above, starting with [11, 17,
    # 41, 73] (A178070), contains primes such that the multiplicative order of
    # 10 (mod p) takes the form 2^i * 5^j, with i,j >= 0. The multiplicative
    # order is the smallest power k such that 10^k â‰£ 1 (mod p), which is the
    # same as saying 10^k % p = 1.
