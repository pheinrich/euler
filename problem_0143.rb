  # Let ABC be a triangle with all interior angles being less than 120
  # degrees. Let X be any point inside the triangle and let XA = p, XC = q,
  # and XB = r.
  #
  # Fermat challenged Torricelli to find the position of X such that
  # p + q + r was minimised.
  #
  # Torricelli was able to prove that if equilateral triangles AOB, BNC and
  # AMC are constructed on each side of triangle ABC, the circumscribed
  # circles of AOB, BNC, and AMC will intersect at a single point, T, inside
  # the triangle. Moreover he proved that T, called the Torricelli/Fermat
  # point, minimises p + q + r. Even more remarkable, it can be shown that
  # when the sum is minimised, AN = BM = CO = p + q + r and that AN, BM and CO
  # also intersect at T (see diagram).
  #
  # If the sum is minimised and a, b, c, p, q and r are all positive integers
  # we shall call triangle ABC a Torricelli triangle. For example, a = 399,
  # b = 455, c = 511 is an example of a Torricelli triangle, with
  # p + q + r = 784.
  #
  # Find the sum of all distinct values of p + q + r â‰¤ 120000 for Torricelli
  # triangles.
