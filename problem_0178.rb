  # Consider the number 45656.
  #
  # It can be seen that each pair of consecutive digits of 45656 has a diff-
  # erence of one. A number for which every pair of consecutive digits has a
  # difference of one is called a step number. A pandigital number contains
  # every decimal digit from 0 to 9 at least once.
  #
  # How many pandigital step numbers less than 10^40 are there?
