  def difficulty; 30 end

  # We shall define a square lamina to be a square outline with a square
  # "hole" so that the shape possesses vertical and horizontal symmetry. For
  # example, using exactly thirty-two square tiles we can form two different
  # square laminae (see diagram).
  #
  # With one-hundred tiles, and not necessarily using all of the tiles at one
  # time, it is possible to form forty-one different square laminae.
  #
  # Using up to one million tiles how many different square laminae can be
  # formed?
